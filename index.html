				<p>The main piece of ergonomic furniture found in most offices is the ergonomic office chair. These chairs have certain features that set them apart from standard office chairs, and which help keep the user sitting upright, rather than slouching, while supporting their lower back, neck, shoulders, hips and thighs.</p>

				<p>How Would You Describe a Comfortable Chair?
				It may sound odd to think about the word “comfortable” when it comes to a chair, but in reality, you spend more time sitting than anything else. So if your office chair or gaming station is not comfortable and causes back pain or other injuries, then it’s definitely worth looking at our selection of gamer and ergonomic chairs.</p>
